# nimCEF

Chromium Embedded Framework(CEF3) wrapper

---

nimCEF is a thin wrapper for CEF3 written in Nim.
Basically, nimCEF is CEF3 C API translated to Nim, therefore
if you know how to use CEF3 C API, using nimCEF is not much different.

Gradually, convenience layer will be added on top of C style API to ease
the development in Nim style and Nim native datatypes will be used whenever possible.
